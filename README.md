# Blue Coding Challenge Documentation

Welcome to the Blue Coding Challenge documentation! This URL shortener is built using Python, Django, and PostgreSQL, with an additional Celery worker for fetching the title of the page from the input URLs and storing them in the database.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:glaubermagal/blue_coding_test.git
cd blue_coding_test
```

Create a `local_settings.py` file in `django_project` folder and set the following constant with the url of your local server with its corresponding port. For example:

```python
BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'
```


## Running the Project

Use Docker Compose to start the project:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Testing

While the project is running, open another terminal and access the server container:

```bash
docker-compose exec server bash
```

Then, run the tests:

```bash
python manage.py test apps/*
```

## Usage

1. **List of the Top 100 Most Visited URLs in descending order:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/list/
   ```

Example output:

```json
[
    {
        "long_url": "https://agilemanifesto.org/",
        "short_url": "http://localhost:8000/y",
        "title": "Manifesto for Agile Software Development"
    },
    {
        "long_url": "https://cloud.google.com/duet-ai?hl=en",
        "short_url": "http://localhost:8000/z",
        "title": "Duet AI for Developers"
    },
    {
        "long_url": "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html",
        "short_url": "http://localhost:8000/10",
        "title": "6. Modules â€” Python 3.12.1 documentation"
    }
]
```

2. **Shorten a URL:**

The endpoint returns the existing shortened URL, or if it's not yet registered, creates a new shortened URL, inserts it in the database and returns it:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/shorten/?url=<long_url>
   ```

Example output:

```json
{
    "short_url": "http://localhost:8000/y"
}
```

3. **Redirect to the Original URL:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/<base62_id>/
   ```

4. **Managing the shortened URLs registered in the database:**

Create a super user

```bash
docker-compose exec server bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Access the admin panel and insert your credentials:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/admin/
```

## Shortening Algorithm

The [shortening algorithm](/apps/urls/utils.py) is based on the [base62](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base62) numeric system. It utilizes the auto-incremented ID field of the URLs table as input to convert the numeric base, achieving the shortest possible length of a unique ID that can be used in a URL.
